                                <p>It was while walking back to the mess that I ran into him. I had just missed the bus from the library minutes ago and had never bothered to memorize the bewildering timetable. I had also lost my cycle keys again – the fifth time in just two years.</p>
                                <p>Hence it was that we ran into each other near Cauvs – I took the long route, with my bag weighing down my shoulders in the soft chill of Chennai autumns, and he humming some vaguely familiar tune on a lazily pedaled cycle.</p>
                                <p>We shared a mess in Himalayas, and had waved at each other a few times over the buttermilk, so he slowed down, and we began chatting along the way. He had recently made it into Nirmaan, where he had been coming from when I ran into him. During our prolonged break – and especially after our results came out – I too had begun thinking about entrepreneurship, and hesitantly told him so.</p>
                                <p><em>‘Go for it, da,’</em>he told me –<em> ‘this has been the most fun I’ve had in ages.’</em></p>
                                <p>Over a cup at Ramu’s, he explained the different ways in which Insti helped through your start-up journey. While there was no set method, it was better to know the basics and the environment before you started anything. He had interned at a few local start-ups during the break and recommended I do the same.</p>
                                <p>I took a slurp, nodding, and instantly burnt my tongue.</p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
