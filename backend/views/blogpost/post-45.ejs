                                <p>Statements like ‘<em>In these testing times…</em>’ or ‘<em>Its been three months since lockdown</em>’have become very cliche and aren’t appealing anymore. Instead statements like ‘<em>We’ve to live with Corona</em>’ or ‘<em>We can’t direct the wind, but we can adjust the sails</em>’ are setting the trend now. After all, it's the basic characteristic of humans to adapt with surroundings.People have now really begun to explore the online version of everything. The biggest proof of this being the Ed-Tech industry.</p>

                                <p>Thinking on the same lines of this quote, schools, colleges, and many startups in India have taken various steps to overcome the limitations put by lockdown and provide education to various categories of students. Since the first lockdown, there has been an astonishing growth in the use of online mediums and e-learning platforms for education. Be it school kids, under-grad students, or competitive exam aspirants, everyone is using various apps and websites. Many schools have begun their ‘e-classes’, where kids attend live lectures and soft copies of study material are also provided to students. The concept sounds simple theoretically but is very hard to manage on the ground level. And yet many schools have proved their metal by successfully executing this. Coming to competitive exams and college students, the valuable contribution of startups of the Ed-Tech sector cannot be ignored. All of them have seen a steep increase in no. of users during the lockdown upon making some changes in their strategies.</p>

Here too, startups have played an essential role.

Also, there is a big change in people’s point of view towards e-learning. As mentioned earlier, people have begun adjusting to the situation and they’re finding solutions to overcome the limitations put by the lockdown. By now, most of us have gained the ability to patiently watch the videos for hours and enlighten ourselves. The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding, it doesn’t matter how we obtain it. So let's learn and learn in every way possible.</p>
