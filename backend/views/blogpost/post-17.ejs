                                    With its flagship product, the iPhone X rolling out in thousands every minute, Apple is gearing up to reach one trillion dollars in market value for the first time in history. This is a company known for its innovation, and for revolutionizing the entire smartphone market. When contrasted with its meagre beginnings, Apple’s influence on the media can only be described as unique. Their products, style, and overall beliefs make the Apple Corporation the most innovative and colourful company in the world.
                                 </p>
                                 <br>
                                 <p>
                                    People don’t buy Apple products just because it’s the best in the market, they buy them because it makes them look like the best, emblazoning and distinguishing them from the crowd. The ubiquitous Apple logo can be identified from a distance and it subliminally conveys a lot about you, the user, and eventually, it breaks the ice and sparks conversations.
                                 </p>
                                 <br>
                                 <p>Have you ever wondered why Apple was so successful? If you think it’s only because of Steve Jobs, then this article is for you.</p>
                                 <br>
                                 <p>Apple revolutionised not just the smartphones but also the world of advertisement by exhibiting the widely known ‘Super Bowl’ commercial for its first Mac which made the crowd in Madison Avenue sit fingers’ crossed and mouth wide open in awe.</p>
                                 <p style="text-align:center;">
                                    <div class ="imggrid1" style = "display: grid ; grid-template-columns:1fr 10fr 1fr">
                                        <img style="grid-column: 2/3" src="/blogimg/post17-1.jpg" alt="Fashion" style="height:500px;width:640px">
                                    </div>
                                </p>
                                 <p>The commercial showed a young athletic woman wearing bright red jogging shorts running toward a giant screen. The screen portrayed a man dictating to hundreds of skinheads, and the girl ran up to the screen and broke it with a baseball bat. The symbolism in this commercial was the main reason it was a pivotal portrayal of Apple in the media. The symbolism of the giant man on the screen represented IBM, and the thousands of skinheads were mindless consumers. Apple was the young athletic woman who broke the screen and freed the thousands of skinheads from a life of monotony with PCs.</p>
                                 <p>
                                 <br>
                                 <p>Innovative and Unprecedented is what the dictionary could come up with, but the world knows that it was a humble beginning for the gargantuan tech-giant that rules the world with its treasury reaching more than 260 billion US dollars and market value exceeding 870 billion dollars. By the time you finish reading this article, it could have made half-a-million dollars.</p>
                                 <br>
                                 <p>In the digital age, it is getting harder and harder to be an individual, but with Apple, you can <a style="font-weight: bold;">“rise above the norm”</a> and be unique, this is what every Apple Ad portrays to you when you are captivated by its slick, sleek and distinguished photography.</p>
                                 <br>
                                 <p>Apple’s campaign for the Mac, <a style="font-weight: bold;">“Get a Mac,</a>” just turned ten years old. It conveys a simple and straightforward message, just as the name would suggest. The message conveyed by Apple’s advertisements are eternally intriguing and tend to charm and enslaves us, irrevocably spawning the obsession to own one of its products.</p>
                                 <br>
                                 <p>Apple’s ad strategies clearly have some differences, they share an elegant simplicity that echoes the company’s own penchant for design and user-friendliness. The widespread parodies and homages to Apple’s various ad campaigns are a testament to their iconic and recognizable nature.</p>
                                 <br>
                                 <p>Almost all of the ads—regardless of which product they’re touting—are shot on a monochrome background and feature little if any text until the conclusion. And all end with a shot of the Apple logo, unifying the products in the minds of consumers and reinforcing both the brand and its image.</p>
                                 <br>
                                 <p>Never in history has Apple boasted of its RAM, Camera pixels or Processor speed; for mundane specifications are replaced with striking features that appeal to our emotional brain rather than our rational brain.</p>
                                 <br>
                                 <p>This is precisely what makes Apple the most popular smartphone brand in the world with more than 1 billion devices sold worldwide, and the trend looks set to continue.</p>

                                        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
