                                <p>Education is the most important factor in the development of an individual as well as a country. In the present world, it has become a vital factor for the future brightness of the new generations of any society. But even while the outside world is buzzing with new innovations in technology, the school curriculum has been stagnant over time, thereby stunting the growth of students in many facades of life. The present-day educational structure molds them into commonplace clerks. Students often learn by rote a lot of random information, and once full, disgorge everything out on the answer sheet. Many educational systems have tried to evolve, by bringing in new concepts like group discussions, but even after this, the students end up lacking in the advanced skills and innovative thinking required to face the hurdles in the present day workplace and market. Thus, entrepreneurial thinking - the capacity not only to start companies but also to think creatively and ambitiously - is very important to be included in the school curriculum.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Integrating the concept of entrepreneurship in education help students from different socioeconomic backgrounds to think outside the box, and nurture unconventional talents and skills, which might be essential to function as a highly-productive unit in the modern economy. Entrepreneurial education is a life-long learning process, and it should be ingrained in students, beginning as students get a basic knowledge of society. Introducing young kids to entrepreneurship helps them to be more creative and self-confident, in the various aspects, and to act in a socioeconomically responsible way. As per our present education system, opportunities for students to create, innovate, collaborate, and demonstrate proficiency or mastery in real-life scenarios become scarce. Entrepreneurship in education not only encourages, but also requires students to be creative, to innovate, and to collaborate with others.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The present-day world holds an uncertain future for the upcoming student generation. So they will obviously need some skills to wade through these uncertain waters, and conquer the dynamic world. The economic environment that these students will be entering is absolutely unpredictable and dynamic, so a rigid syllabus will not guide them to discover their true potential. Without a doubt they need entrepreneurship in education, enabling them to seek out problem-solving opportunities, get acquainted with the market situation, think creatively, take risks, and accept failures as a part of life. This will help them in understanding the correlation between hard work and success. Grades, intelligence, socioeconomic status, and the other usual suspects do not stack up to the characteristic definition of grit. Students learn grit through entrepreneurship because the entrepreneurial process is both demanding and uncertain. These experiences can be extremely beneficial for students to learn before they graduate and face the real world, cash scenarios and people-in-need situations. Entrepreneurs prove to be some of the grittiest people on the planet, and grit can be taught through entrepreneurial education.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Entrepreneurs, by definition, are people who aim to make a difference in the way society has charted its path forward. From a business point of view, entrepreneurs seek to solve problems, meet needs, and ease pain or difficulty as a means of selling products or services. In the social sense, entrepreneurs seek to solve problems because of the impact ideas and solutions can make on human beings or on the environment. Either way, students trained in entrepreneurship enter the world not only trained to identify problems that need solving, but also determined to creatively solve problems, meet needs, and make the world a better place.</p>

                                        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
